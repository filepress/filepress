# Documentation

This is to provide an entry into filepress development.

The name filepress references old time [letterpresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterpress_printing). Before they were used to form letters into books. Now filepress is used to form files into blogs.

## Basics

filepress processes all markdown files in a given source folder and then does the following with these:

- create [blob]s for each markdown file
- pass them into a stream
- apply transformations to the [blob]s
- write new files

By passing the [blob]s throuch a stream we simply pick a way of thinking about the transformations happening to the [blob]s. This enable us a functional approach to organizing our code. We will have simple transformations which will receive and return a [blob], altering it in the process as well as a way to compose such transformations. To achieve this filepress provides:

- **use** a way to add a transformation.
- **collect** a way to pull all [blob]s into an array and work with that. This is necessary to create sites like indexes of blogs or category pages.
- **seperate** a way to spread the array out again.

There are also some build in transformations:

- **frontmatter** extracts YML formatted frontmatter.
- **markdown** parses markdown to html.
- **layouts** wraps things in a template.
- **write** write files to disc.
- **buildIndex** builds an index page for a blog.

[blob] objects will always have at leas the following attributes. Transforms may add more.

```javascript
//Example for a [blob] object in the stream.
{
  sourcePath,   //Where this file originally came from
  path,         //The path to save this file to (at first where it came from)
  extension,    //The extension of the current content
  content,      //Content of the file
  written       //If the file was already saved

  //There may be more attributes generated by transforms.
}
```

## Transformations

Transformations will likely want to be functions that take configuration parameters and return function. The function ultimately returned should accept a [blob] and return one. Inbetween doing any transformation. This could for example be the extraction of frontmatter or the parsing of markdown content into html.

A simple logger would look like this:

```javascript
const logger = (obj) => {

	//Log any object processed.
	console.log(obj)

	//Make sure to return the [blob] to keep running.
	return obj
}
```

Here is an example of a logger which takes a parameter to indent the logged object.

```javascript
const logger = (indents) => {

	//Return the real transformation.
	return (obj) => {

		//Log object nicely formatted with indents specified.
		console.log(JSON.stringify(obj, null, indents))
		return obj
	}
}
```

Ever since the glorious times of ES2015 we have an even shorter way of writing this.

```javascript
const logger = (indents) => (obj) => {
	console.log(JSON.stringify(obj, null, indents))
	return obj
}
```

You should know about or check out:

- ES6 (ES2015)
- [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/index.html)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

It could help to know about:

- Functional programming
- [highlandJS](http://highlandjs.org/) or working with streams in general
- [CommanderJS](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/) or basis for the CLI
- [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Or just work with us on filepress and expand your knowledge.

## Another site generator

This project was first started by [Hendrik](https://github.com/HoverBaum) and is greatly inspired by [hexo](https://hexo.io/) and [metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/).

> Fully aware that many such generators exist I wanted one that runs on JS as that is what I am familiar with. I greatly like how hexo is easy to use with the CLI and how metalsmith can be configured programmatically. So I want to bring those two things together and then build even further. I also just like to build things myself ^^
