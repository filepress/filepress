# Working with Git

This document gives a guideline on how to use Git, how to style commit messages and organize collaboration.

Following the same patterns will make it easier for all members of our team to follow along with what is happening.

## Commit messages

- Should be writen in the present ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Think something like "When applied this commit will [your message here]"
- Use Emoji to highlight what type of commit this is
- Stick to a subject line followed by a new line followed by a message body

### Example

```text
:books: Add techStack and Git docs

Add documentation for tech Stack

Suggest Emojis to format commit messages nicely
```

Which will show up as:
>:books: Add techStack and Git docs

>Add documentation for tech Stack

>Suggest Emojis to format commit messages nicely
