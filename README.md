# filepress

filepress envisions an easy to use website and blog generating system that is aimed at both non tech savvy users and developers. We aim to achieve this by providing a usable commandline tool as well as a programmatic interface to use our system. Later we will also provide a graphical tools to create and manage blogs and websites using filepress.

The repository at https://github.com/filepress/proofOfConcept provides an idea of how things could look and just proves that our approach can work.
